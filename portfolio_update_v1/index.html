        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am currently employed as an insurance and financial advisor but I am trying to work my way out of the industry. I have wanted to be involved in web development for as long as I can remember and have decided to stop proscrastinating.</p>
        <p>I've owned an insurance agency and a successful lawn care company, but neither interest me as much as coding and programming always have. </p>
      </div> 

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to be highly skilled in both front-end and back-end programming languages to be a part of developing websites, apps, and other software. I hope to come proficient in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'd love a career in web design and being employed by a reputable company helping others, but I also want the ability to create my own websites and develop my own programs.</p>
